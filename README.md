Dashboard for youtube transcript analysis - child safety/profanity - January 2023


This is a little locally hosted dashboard I created using Plotly Dash. Using the youtube API, I performed text cleaning and analysis to determine if a youtube channel is "child-safe."


Users can search for youtube channels, and are provided with channel names and descriptions
